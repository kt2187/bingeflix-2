#### Apply Bloom’s taxonomy to analyze, understand, and differentiate the technical aspects of two applications and combine them into your own version of the application. 

#### This application combines features of the Practical Javascript Todo List tutorial by Gordon Zhu(https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript) and JavaScript and the DOM by Net Ninja(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIORjGvT0kk&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gfoKa5la9dsdCNpuey2s-V).

#### I've changed the concept of the application from books to read to movies to watch and added a list to move the watched movies into. I willing be fixing bugs and updating features soon.
